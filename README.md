An example ETL Design for the csv files from different sources

Each source has its own implementation and they return suitable transformed series for each column


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python main.py -d <output directory path> -o <output-file-name>
```

See the resulted csv file at the `<output-directory-path>/<output-file-name>`
